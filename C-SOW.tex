If non-contiguous memory locations are in the same banks, we will leverage the throughput improvement of the spatiotemporal boosting technique for minimizing latency penalty for accessing non-contiguous memory locations. We will maximize circuit portions that are not boosted such that we can use them as thermal buffer and extend the time and spatial range of supply voltage boosting.
