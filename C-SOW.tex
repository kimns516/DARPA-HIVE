Task 3.X: Our accelerator chip fabrication and chip-level testing \underline{Seok (Columbia), Kim (UIUC), Hanumolu (UIUC), Annavaram (USC), Hwu (UIUC)}
Completion criteria: fabricated chips, verified in the chip level
Approach: We will perform intensive pre-silicon verifications for functional, thermal, voltage integrity, noise, and testability aspects. We will tape-out the accelerator chip in a 28nm CMOS technology. We will test the accelerator chip without DiRAMs. 
Task 3.2: 2.5D integration of our accelerator chip and memory stacks, packaging, and testing \underline{?}
Completion criteria and deliverables: Functioning 2.5D integrated hardware of the accelerators and DiRAMs. 
Approach:  We will integrate the accelerator chip with two DiRAMs using a silicon interposer. 
The silicon interposer that creates 2,000 connection to the accelerator chip per DiRAM will be fabricated by a company (XXXXX). 
The interposer will be either connected to a custom PCB directly or enclosed on a BGA type package. 
If necessary, we will mount a off-the-shelf cooler, potentially modified to fit, on top of the accelerator chip.
