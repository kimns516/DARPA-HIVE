\noindent
\textbf{OpenCAPI:} Although OpenCAPI is expected to be released in this year, it is still under development and may not be ready by the beginning of Phase 2, or IBM may not be able provide the OpenCAPI link PHY due to complex IP term issues.
OpenCAP is more desirable due to the cache coherece support, we can still replace OpenCAPI with PCIe, as PCIe Gen3 PHY IPs are provided by the foundry.

\noindent
\textbf{DiRAM4:} - Although DiRAM4 is expected to be available by early 2017 and more preferrable to HBM, it is sill under development, as well.
If it is not available by the end of the first quarter of Phase 1, we will replace DiRAM4 with HBM and especially utilize the pseudo channel feature of HBM to efficiently support both random and sequential accesses.
