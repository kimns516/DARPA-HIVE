\textbf{DiRAM4.} Although DiRAM4 is expected to be available by early 2017 and more preferrable to HBM, it is sill under development.
If it is not available by the end of the first quarter of Phase 1, we will replace DiRAM4 with HBM and especially utilize the pseudo channel feature of HBM to efficiently support both random and sequential accesses. 
The pseudo channel splits one 128-bit memory channel into two 64-bit channels and allows independent channel accesses although two pseudo channels share the same command/address bus.
Our preliminary study showed that the shared command/address bus is unlikely the performance bottleneck.

\textbf{OpenCAPI.} Although OpenCAPI is expected to be released in this year, it is still under development and may not be ready by the beginning of Phase 2, or IBM may not be able provide necessary OpenCAPI IP blocks.
If OpenCAPI is unavailable in time, we will replace OpenCAPI with PCIe for the connection between GAMA tiles and the host system, as PCIe Gen3 PHY IPs is part of the physical design library provided by the foundry.
Then, we will adopt a memory model like discrete GPUs in which APIs explicitly manages data transfer between the GAMA tiles and the host system.
