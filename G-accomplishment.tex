Our team is comprised of five PIs with circuit, architecture, programming model, and compiler expertise. 
While we are not pursuing TA2, one PI (Hwu) is also an expert in programming models and compilers for GPUs and graph analytics. 
Thus we anticipate a speedier path to incorporate innovations from TA2 into our architecture design and syner-gistically work with other TA2 teams.

\textbf{Seok} (\url{http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~mgseok}) is an Assistant Professor at Columbia University, conducting research on various aspects of digital, analog, mixed-signal, and VLSI system-on-chip design and prototyping. 
His expertise includes energy-efficient embedded memory and pipeline designs. 
In these areas, Seok has (co)led more than 20 chip prototyping projects, sponsored by DARPA, NSF, Samsung, SKHynix, and other institutions in the past. 
The results of the projects were published in more than 70 articles in the top conferences and journals such as ISSCC, VLSI, CICC, JSSC, TCAS-I, TVLSI, etc.
%Among those, the results that are the most relevant to this project are: ultra-low-power embedded SRAM design with spatiotemporal speed-up ability that contributes the most energy-efficient and the most compact FFT core\footnote{J.P. Cerqueira et al., ISSCC'17, submitted}; 
%and non-invasive voltage-scalable thermal sensors for accurate dynamic thermal management\footnote{Yang et al., ISSCC'14 and JSSC'15}\footnote{Kim et al., CICC'15}; and in-situ error detection and correction technique for parallel and specialized architectures\footnote{S.
