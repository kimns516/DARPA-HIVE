%MURALI

Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of computationally intensive applications on users' devices for military operations, such as image/video recognition for surveillance and autonomous navigation, augmented reality on mobile devices, and cyber security via real-time network log analysis of the users. These big data processing applications have been an exclusive domain of large enterprise class servers and datacenters. But in many of these application domains much of the data needed is collected at the edge devices such as sensors, mobile platforms. The data is then channelled through a collection of networked computation points to the backend servers. There is a significant amount of computing capability that is embedded along the entire path from edge to the cloud. Hence, exploiting these dispersed computing capabilities is not only beneficial for performance and power, but it is also required in the context of military operations, where uncertainty in available bandwidth and latency in decision making are critical considerations. In many scenarios access to the cloud can be very limited, or it may require significant backhaul data movement that is infeasible. As a result,  there is a critical need for enabling \emph{dispersed computing}, in which computation is carried out using the computational resources that are locally available to the users.

\section{Management Plan}
\vspace{-0.1in}
The project requires expertise in distributed computing, online algorithms, communications, networking and runtime systems.  Towards that end, the proposed team consists of three prime members with the following expertise and unique capabilities:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0ex,partopsep=0ex,parsep=0ex,leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Dr. Salman Avestimehr (PI)} has expertise in distributed computing, coding, data analytics, network information theory, and communication networks. His major recent research accomplishment that is most relevant to this project is the invention of \emph{Coded Distributed Computing}~\cite{LMA_all,ComCom16,ComComJ16,EdgeCompG,EdgeCompACM} that provides a novel joint computing and communication design framework for distributed computing to significantly reduce the bandwidth consumption and response latency. 
\item \textbf{Dr. Murali Annavaram (co-PI)} is an expert in runtime systems for mobile computing, energy efficient computer system architecture, reliability and availability of high performance computing, and datacenter design.  His major recent research accomplishment that is most relevant to this project is a practical computational offloading system built on top of Android OS~\cite{lee2012wireless, annavaram2015runtime}, which was exclusively licensed to a major mobile device vendor for product adoption.
\item \textbf{Dr. Bhaskar Krishnamachari (co-PI)} has expertise in the design and analysis of algorithms and protocols for networked communication and computation, using tools from combinatorial algorithms, online learning, network utility optimization and game theory. His major  relevant accomplishments include the design of Hermes, the first $1+\epsilon$ approximation algorithm (FPTAS) for minimizing the latency (makespan) of scheduling the distributed computation for a large class of task graphs on an arbitrary network of processors~\cite{Hermes2015}, and LLR, the first polynomial-regret policy for online network optimization~\cite{Gai2012}. 
\end{itemize}


Dr. Avestimehr will be the principal investigator (PI) and responsible for overall project management. The three prime members are highly committed to collaborative research, and have already established a very effective and efficient collaborative environment. The task responsibilities of prime team members are shown in Table~\ref{table:roles}. There will also be one senior programmer, one postdoctoral scholar, and four PhD students involved in the project, with the following roles:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0ex,partopsep=0ex,parsep=0ex,leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Senior Research Programmer.} The senior research programmer (SRP) will assist in porting the coded optimization algorithms onto the two testbeds. SRP will be responsible for interacting with dispersive technologies to understand the system usage APIs and to port the algorithms developed by the PIs to match the testbed-specific needs. For the USC testbed, SRP will  be responsible for bringing up the Arduino and Raspberry Pi setups and interface them with appropriate sensors. SRP will setup the desktop computing infrastructure to enable appropriate RDMA, RoCE and RSCSI on the underlying hardware. SRP will also work with the graduate students and PIs to translate the code/data movement choices to use the right set of underlying interfaces and APIs in the heterogeneous testbeds.    
\item \textbf{Postdoctoral Scholar.} We will involve one postdoctoral scholar with expertise in distributed computing, resource allocation for computation workflows, and coding. The postdoctoral scholar will co-supervised by Dr. Avestimehr and Dr. Krishnamachari, and will facilitate collaborations between Tasks 1 and 2 in Phase 1, and Tasks 1 and 2 in Phase 2.
\item \textbf{PhD Students.} We will involve four PhD Student to work full time on this project. The first PhD student will focus on Task 1 in Phases 1 and 2, and will be supervised by Dr. Krishnamachari, the second PhD student will focus on Task 2 in Phases 1 and 2, and will be supervised by Dr. Avestimehr, the third PhD student will focus on Task 2 in Phases 1 and 2, and will be supervised by Dr. Annavaram, and the fourth PhD student will be co-supervised by Dr. Annavaram and Dr. Krishnamachari and collaborate on Tasks 1 and 3 in Phases 1 and 2, in order to facilitate interactions between these tasks.

\noindent \textbf{Effort Coordination.} We will organize bi-weekly meetings in which all team member participate. The goal of the meeting will be to (1) discuss the new results obtained in the project, (2) identify new problems and research directions for collaboration, and (3) set the milestones for next meeting. We expect that at these meetings students will present an in-depth presentation of their current work and research progress to the entire group. To the extent possible our team will use existing open technological infrastructure such as github, trac and wikis to boost productivity. USC has extensive expertise in running open systems and will leverage these resources for this project. Our wiki site will be used initially for documenting the research progress internally, discussions on related work. The web site will serve as a repository for publications, annual program plans, quarterly progress reports, notes from meetings,  and all other products of research.
