\textbf{Columbia University.} 
Seok maintains a 600 sq-ft laboratory with 11 stations for designing VLSI hardware, and 5 stations for testing VLSI hardware. 
The available instruments include a high-precision current-meters, desktop multi-meter, five workstations equipped with National Instrument (NI) Labview digital/analog acquisition/actuation boards, programmable -40/+140oC environmental chambers, a professional soldering station and multiple programmable power supplies. 
Seok has accesses to a variety of software including NI Academic Site License for automated testing; industrial EDA tools for designing VLSI chips, FPGAs, and PCBs, which include Synopsis H-SPICE, DesignCompiler, PowerCompiler, PrimeTime, PrimePower, Mentor-Graphics Eldo, Calibre, Cadence Virtuoso, Spectre, Encounter/Velocity, ELC; the nanometer VLSI technology design kits from 180nm down to 28nm nodes; and standard core cell, IO cells, and bonding pad libraries for most of those technologies for design automation. 
Seok maintains 7 high performance Linux computing servers (each server has 4 to 24 cores and 16-32GB RAM), 9 Linux/Windows workstations, and an 8TB file-server.

\textbf{University of Illinois.}
Kim, Hanumolu, and Hwu are affiliated with Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL). 
Kim and Hwu maintain a cluster of 12 Intel Xeon-based dual-socket servers and a cluster of 24 AMD APU-based single-socket servers, 
connected by a stack of high-speed Ethernet switches linked to the campus network backbone with a 100Gb/s uplink to the CSL facility protected behind the campus firewall.
These two clusters provide more than 300 CPU cores, facilitating fast exploration of various system architectures, simulation of a system designed at the register-transfer and gate levels, and physical design of chips for the project.
% Pavan - can you write about the libraries, tools, and measurement equipment, etc.?
Hanumolu has accesses to the state-of-the-art circuit design, analysis, and synthesis tools from Cadence and Synopsys.
