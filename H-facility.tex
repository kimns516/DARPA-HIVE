The three investigators (Kim, Hanumolu, and Hwu) are affiliated with Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL). 
The PIs maintain a cluster of 12 Intel Xeon-based dual-socket servers and a cluster of 24 AMD APU-based single-socket servers, connected by a stack of high-speed Ethernet switches linked to the campus network backbone with a 100Gb/s uplink to the CSL facility protected behind the campus firewall.
These two clusters provide more than 300 CPU cores, facilitating fast exploration of various system architectures, simulation of a system designed at the register-transfer and gate levels, and physical design of chips for the project.
% Pavan - can you write about the libraries, tools, and measurement equipment, etc.?
The PIs also have access to the state-of-the-art circuit design, analysis, and synthesis tools from Cadence and Synopsys.

\textbf{Columbia University:} 
Seok’s group maintains a state-of-the-art laboratory, VLSI Design Lab, for designing characterizing custom VLSI chips. It is located in the 12th floor Seeley W. Mudd building in Columbia University. The 600 sq-ft laboratory supports 11 stations for designing VLSI hardware, and five stations for testing VLSI hardware. The available instruments include a high-precision current-meters, desktop multi-meter, high-speed oscilloscopes, five workstations equipped with National Instrument (NI) Labview digital/analog acquisition/actuation boards, programmable -40/+140oC environmental chambers, a professional soldering station and multiple programmable power supplies. We also have a variety of software including NI Academic Site License for automated testing. 
Seok’s group also maintains the research computing clusters with seven high performance Linux computing servers (each server has 4 to 24 cores and 16-32GB RAM), nine Linux/Windows workstations, and an 8TB file-server. Additionally, we have access to an extensive array of industrial EDA tools for designing VLSI chips, FPGAs, and PCBs, which include Synopsis H-SPICE, DesignCompiler, PowerCompiler, PrimeTime, PrimePower, Mentor-Graphics Eldo, Calibre, Cadence Virtuoso, Spectre, Encounter/Velocity, ELC. In addition, Seok’s group maintains the nanometer VLSI technology design kits from 180nm down to 28nm nodes. We also maintain standard core cell, IO cells, and bonding pad libraries for most of those technologies for design automation.
