\textbf{University of Illinois:}
The three investigators (Kim, Hanumolu, and Hwu) are affiliated with Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL). 
The PIs maintain a cluster of 12 Intel Xeon-based dual-socket servers and a cluster of 24 AMD APU-based single-socket servers, connected by a stack of high-speed Ethernet switches linked to the campus network backbone with a 100Gb/s uplink to the CSL facility protected behind the campus firewall.
These two clusters provide more than 300 CPU cores, facilitating fast exploration of various system architectures, simulation of a system designed at the register-transfer and gate levels, and physical design of chips for the project.
% Pavan - can you write about the libraries, tools, and measurement equipment, etc.?
The PIs also have access to the state-of-the-art circuit design, analysis, and synthesis tools from Cadence and Synopsys.
