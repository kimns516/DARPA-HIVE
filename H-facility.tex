The three investigators (Kim, Hanumolu, and Hwu) are affiliated with Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL). 
Established in 1951, CSL is an internationally respected leader in telecommunications and information technology research. 
CSL maintains a very rich computing environment of approximately 1,350 machines encompassing nearly every major type of server, workstation, and personal computer and running a wide variety of operating systems and application software. 
Approximately 1,200 computers are in the production environment and are connected by a stack of high-speed Ethernet switches linked to the campus network backbone with a 100Gb/s uplink to the CSL facility. 
CSLâ€™s networks are protected behind the campus firewall, as well as a firewall within the facility. 
The PIs maintain a cluster of 12 Intel Xeon-based dual-socket servers and a cluster of 24 AMD APU-based single-socket servers. 
These two clusters provide more than 300 CPU cores, facilitating fast exploration of various system architectures, simulation of a system designed at the register-transfer and gate levels, and physical design of chips for the project.
% Pavan - can you write about the libraries, tools, and measurement equipment, etc.?
The PIs also have access to the state-of-the-art circuit design, analysis, and synthesis tools from Cadence and Synopsys.
