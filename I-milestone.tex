%Schedules and measurable milestones for the proposed research. 
%(Note: Measurable milestones should capture key development points in tasks and should be clearly articulated and defined in time relative to start of effort.) 
%Where the effort consists of multiple portions which could reasonably be partitioned for purposes of funding, these should be identified as options.
Table~\ref{tab:milestone} summarizes our schedule and milestones.
The order of tasks in Table~\ref{tab:milestone} depicts the dependency amongst tasks.
The detailed completion creteria of each task is described in Section~\ref{sec:sow}.
