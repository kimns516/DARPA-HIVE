%Deliverables associated with the proposed research. See Part II, Section I (A through C) for a
%minimum list of data and material deliverables for each Technical Area. For all technical
%areas, expected deliverables include quarterly technical status reports, monthly financial
%status reports, and a final report at the end of each phase. 

%Include in this section all proprietary claims to the results, prototypes, Intellectual Property, or systems supporting
%and/or necessary for the use of the research, results, and/or prototype. If there are no
%proprietary claims, this should be stated. For forms to be completed regarding Intellectual
%Property, see Section VIII. There will be no page limit for the listed forms and the forms will
%not be included in the total page count.

% Key final deliverables
%An accelerator architecture and processor pipeline which supports the processing of
%identified graph primitives in a native matrix format.
%b) A chip (or possibly multichip) architecture that support the easy movement of data from
%memory or IOs to the accelerators based on an identified data flow model. Emphasis
%should be on redefining cache based architectures so that they address both sparse and
%dense data sets. Integration of the processor and memory architecture may be necessary.
%c) An external memory controller which is designed to ensure efficient us of the identified
%data mapping tools. The controller should be able to efficiently handle random as well as
%sequential memory accesses. Every effort should be made to minimize the size of the data
%access to avoid the need to pad memory. The use of advanced memory technology may
%be necessary.
