\noindent
\textbf{Phase 1:}
\begin{itemize}
\item An architecture simulator that models our proposed accelerator, its memory sub-system in-cluding custom memory controller, and the interface with host systems.
\item Circuit schematics of power-efficient 1TB/s links and on-chip eDRAM with spatial voltage boosting.
\item A detailed report that describes the accelerator, memory sub-system, and system architec-tures, and 1TB/s links; evaluates the performance; and projects the power consumption.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Phase 2:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The RTL code for the proposed accelerator and its memory sub-system.
\item The FPGA prototype and PCB schematic of a single node connected to a host system.
\item The GDSII of our accelerator chip.
\item A detailed report that describes the prototype.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Phase 3:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The fabricated accelerator dies, each comprised of 32 cores and eDRAM, and the packages, each integrating an accelerator die with four 8GB DiRAM4â„¢ 3D Memory dies.
\item The manufactured PCBs with all the components integrated (i.e., nodes).
\item A full-system evaluation setup with a detailed performance/power evaluation report.
\end{itemize}
